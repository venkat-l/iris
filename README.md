# iris
Classification of iris flowers from the dataset from UCI Machine Learning repository. This is a complete project written in Python, using Pandas and sklearn.
The goal of this project is to provide a path to rightly use the tools that Python provides to identify the class of flowers from the iris
dataset. Ultimately, we will strive to provide a model that most correctly identifies the class, given the data 'sepal-length', 'sepal-width', 'petal-length', 'petal-width'.
